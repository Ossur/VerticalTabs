Still in alpha phase. Should work with all editors.

What is working:
- Sorting -> manual (drag & drop), by project, by name
- Pin tab - even if editor is closed the tab will not disappear from the view and on press the editor will be re-opened
- saving sorting at close of eclipse
- grouping like in Edge cards
